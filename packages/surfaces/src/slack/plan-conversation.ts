${stackedWorkflowSection}
Rules:
1. Explore the codebase first (list directories, read key files). Then USE what you learned in your response — reference specific files, components, and patterns you found. Do NOT give generic responses that ignore the code you read.
2. For ambiguous implementation requests, tiny nits, or broad "make this better" requests, do a brief scoping pass before YAML:
   - State concise assumptions based on the repository evidence you found.
   - Show a short plan preview with the likely review slice(s) and verification commands.
   - Ask at most 1-2 clarifying questions only when the answer would materially change the plan. If the assumptions are safe, continue to YAML in the same response after the preview.
3. Keep plans focused. ${preferStackedWorkflows ? 'For reviewable multi-slice implementation work, prefer 2-6 stacked child workflows with one local implementation-and-verification slice each, instead of one workflow with many independent implementation tasks. ' : ''}For small nits, prefer one reviewable implementation slice plus focused verification instead of a large workflow.
4. File-count guidance is a soft heuristic, not a hard validator gate. Prefer small reviewable slices (for example around 10 files per implementation task when practical), but exceed this when correctness or shared wiring requires broader edits.
5. Each task should have either a \`command\` or a \`prompt\`, not both. Do not include legacy \`autoFix\` or \`autoFixRetries\` fields anywhere in the YAML; auto-fix retries are configured only in ~/.invoker/config.json.
6. Every step MUST be testable. Every implementation task MUST have a corresponding test task that verifies it works using a concrete, executable \`command\` discovered from the target repo (e.g. that repo's package scripts, build commands, or focused checks such as \`git diff --name-only\`). The test command must produce a clear pass/fail exit code. Do NOT skip tests for any step. Do NOT use prompts for test tasks — use commands only.
   Test command rules:
   - Inspect repo manifests and existing docs/scripts before choosing commands.
   - Use the package manager and test runner the target repo already uses; do not impose Invoker-specific commands on external repos.
   - For focused package tests in a monorepo, run from the relevant package/workspace directory or use the repo's documented workspace filter.
   - To target a specific test file, use the syntax supported by the discovered test script.
   - Prefer focused verification during iteration and reserve broad/full-suite commands for the final gate only when the target repo documents such a command.
   - If Invoker config auto-routes heavyweight commands, keep discovered test/build commands as normal command tasks unless the task must name a specific remote target
   - NEVER invent test file names. Verify the test file exists before referencing it in a command.
7. Use meaningful task IDs (kebab-case).
8. ${handoffInstructions}
9. Always include \`dependencies\` (even if empty array).
10. Choose \`mergeMode\` deliberately. \`pull_request\` plans default to \`mergeMode: external_review\` so changes land through the canonical GitHub-backed review gate. Use \`mergeMode: manual\` for verification-only plans that should not open a review, and use \`mergeMode: automatic\` only when the user explicitly wants changes merged without review.`;
